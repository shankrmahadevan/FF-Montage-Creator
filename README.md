Neural Network that extracts Montage from Free Fire Gameplay
This program automatically extracts highlights from Freefire Gameplay, and compiles it into a video. It's essentially a Convolutional Neural Network that extracts the highlights from the gameplay. I collected almost 20k images to train the Neural Network and I am planning to upload the dataset on kaggle, soon. 
I applied transfer learning to a MobileNetV2 model pretrained on ImageNet.

To use this on colab:
Open this notebook in colab and run the cells. https://github.com/shankrmahadevan/FF-Montage-Creator/blob/main/FFMontage_Extractor.ipynb
